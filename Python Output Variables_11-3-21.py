# > Output Variables
# the python print statement is often used to output variables.
#To combine both text and a variable ,python uses the + character
# x="awesome"
# print("python is "+x)
#  + character to add a variable to another variable.
# x='Python is '
# y='awesome'
# z=x+y
# print(z)
# >For number ,the + character works as a mathematical operator:
# e.g
# x=5
# y=10
# print(x+y)
# if you try to combine a string and a number,python will give you an error
# x=5
# y="Swapnil"
# print(x+y)
