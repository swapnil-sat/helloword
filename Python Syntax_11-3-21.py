# > Execute python syntax
# python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the command line
# Or by creating a python file on the server using the .py file extension and running in the command  line
# >Python indentation
# it is refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line .
# where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only,the indentation in python is very important
# it is uses indentation to indicate a block of code
# e.g
# if  5>2 :
#         print("five is greater then two!")
# it will give you an error if you skip the indentation:
# ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
# Syntax Error
# if 5>2:
#     print("Five is greater than Two!")
# the number of spaces is up to you as a programmer but it has to be at least one
# e.g
# if 5>2 :
#     print("Five is greater than two!")
# if 5>2 :
#
#
# print("Five is greater than two!")
# you have to used the same number of spaces in the same block of code otherwise Python will give you an error:
# ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
#>Python Variables.
# in python ,variables are created when you assign a value to it.
# e.g
# variables in python.
# x=5
# y="Hello"
# print(x)
# print(y)
# Python has no command for declearing a variable .
# ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
# >Comments
# comment start with a '#' and python will render the rest of the line as comment.
# e.g
# this is comment
# print("hello world")
