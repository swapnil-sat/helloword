# >>>Loop through a tuple.
# by use a for loop.
# E.x
# Iterate through the items and print the values.
# thistuple=("apple","banana","Cherry")
# for x in thistuple:
#     print(thistuple)
# >>Loop through the index number.
# use the range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable.
# E.x
# print all items byb referring to their index number.
# thistuple=("apple","banana","cherry")
# for i in range(len(thistuple)):
#     print(thistuple[i])
# Using a While loop<<<<<
# use the len() function to deterine the length of the tuple then start at 0 and loop your way through the tuple items by refering to their indexes.
# remember to increase the index by 1 after each iteration .
# E.x
# print all items ,using a while loop to go through all the index number.
# thistuple=("apple","banana","cherry")
# i=0
# while i<len(thistuple):
#     print(thistuple[i])
#     i=i+1
