# Access Items
# you cannot access items in a set by referring to an index or a key.
# but you can loop  through the set items using a for loop or ask if a specified value is present in a set by using the in
# keyword.
# E.x
# Loop through the set,and print the values:
# thisset={"apple","banana","Cherry"}
# for x in thisset:
#     print(x)
#E.X
# check if "banana" is present in the set.
# thisset={"apple","banana","cherry"}
# print("banana"in thisset)
# >>>Change Items<<<<
# Once a set is created you cannt change its items but you can add new items.
