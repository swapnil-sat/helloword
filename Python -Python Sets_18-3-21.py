#Set:- sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable set is one of 4 built in data types in python used to store
# collection of data the other are List,Tuple,and Dictionary all with different qualities and used it
# A set is a collection which is both unordered and uniindexed.
# Sets are written with curly brackets.
# E.x
# Create a list.
# thisset={"apple","banana","cherry"}
# print(thisset)
# note -sets are unordered so you cannot be sure in which order the item will appear.
# Set Items-
# set items are unordered,unchangable,and do not allow duplicate values.
# >>>Unordered<<<<<
# items in a set do not have a defined order .
# set items can appear in a different order every time you use them and cannot be referred to by index or key.
# Unchangeable
# sets are unchangable meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created .
# Note-once a set is created you cannot change its items ,but you can add new items.
# >>>Duplicate not allowed.
# sets cannt have two items with the same value.
# E.x
# # Duplicate values will be ignored:-
# thisset={"apple","banana","cherry","apple"}
# print(thisset)
# >>Get the length of a set.
# to determine how many items a set has ,use the len() method.
# E.x
# get the number of items in a set :
# thisset={"apple","banana","cherry"}
# print(len(thisset),thisset)
# Set Items-Data types....
# set items can be of any data type...
# E.x
# string,int and boolean data types.
# set1={"apple","banana","cherry"}
# set2={1,2,3,4,5}
# set3=(True,False)
# print(set1)
# print(set2)
# print(set3)
# a set contain differnt data types.
# Ex.
# A set with strings integers and boolean values.
# set1={"abc",34,True,40,"male"}
# print(set1)
# >>>type()
# sets are defined as objects with the data type 'set'
# <class set>
# E.x
# what is the data type of a set.
# myset={"apple","banana","cherry"}
# print(type(myset))
# >>>>the set constructor<<<<
# it is also possible to use the set() constructor to make a set .
# E.x
# thisset=set(("apple","banana","cherry"))
# print(type(thisset),thisset)
# python Collection (Arrays)
# there are four collection data types in the python programming .
# List-is a collection of which is ordered and changable allows duplicate members.
# Tuple-is a collection which is ordered and unchangable allows duplicate members.
# Set-is a collection which is unordered and unidexed no duplicate members.
# Dictionary-is a collction which is unordered and changeable .No duplicate members.
