# >>>>Tuple<<<<<
# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in python used to store collection of data the other 3 are list,setand dictionary.
# all with different qualities and usages.
# tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangebale.
# tuples are  written with round brackes.
# E.x
# create a tuple.
# mytuple=("apple","banana","cherry")
# print(mytuple)
# >>>tuple items
# tuple items are ordered and unchangable ,allow duplicate values.
# tuple items are indexed ,the first item has index[0] the second item has index[1] etc.
# >>>ORDERED<<<<<
# when we say that tuples are ordered it means that the items have a defined order and that ortder will not change.
# >>>Unchangebale<<<<<
# tuples are unchangable ,meaning that we cannot change ,add or remove items after the tuple has benn created.
# >>>>Allow Duplicates.
# since tuples are indexed ,tuples can have items with the same value.
# E.x
# tuples allow duplicate values:
# thistuple=("apple","banana","cherry","apple","cherry")
# print(thistuple)
# >>>Tuple length <<<<<<
# to determine how many items a tuple has,use the len() function.
# E.x
# print the number of items in the tuple:
# thistuple=("apple","banana","cherry","apple","cherry")
# print(len(thistuple))
# >>>Create a tuple with one item .
# to create a tuple with only one item you have to add a comma after the item otherwise Pyhton will not recognize it as a tuple
# E.x
# one  item tuple ,remember the comma,
# thistuple=("apple",)
# print(type(thistuple))
# NOT a tuple.
# thistuple=("apple")
# print(type(thistuple))
# >>>tuple items-Data types<<<<<
# Tuple items can be of any data type:
# E.x
# >>>DATA TYPES<<<<<<
# tuple items can be of any data type:
# E.x
# String ,int and bollean data types:
# thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")
# tuple2=(1,2,3,4,5)
# tuple3(True,False,False)
# A tuple can contain different data types:
# E.x
# A tuple with strings,integers and boolean values:
# tuple1=("abc",34,True,40,"male")
# print(tuple1)
# >>>Type()
# tuples are defined as objects with the data type 'tuple'
# <class 'tuple'>
# E.x
# what is the data type of a tuple?
# mytuple=("apple","banana","cherry")
# print(type(mytuple))
# >>>The tuple Constructor<<<<<
# it is also possible to use the tuple() constructor to make a tuple.
# E.x
# Using the tuple() method to make a tuple:
# a=tuple(("apple","banana","cherry","apple","cherry"))
# print(type(a),a)
# >Python collection (Arrays)
# there are four collection data types in the python programming language:
# >List- it is collection which is ordered and changable allows duplicate members.
# >Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangable allows duplicate members.
# >set-is a collection which is unordered and unidexed No duplicate members.
# >Dictionary-is a collection which is unordered and changeable.NO duplicate members.
# when a choosing a collection type it is useful to understand the properties of that type. choosing the right type for a
# particular data set could mean retention of meaning and it could mean an increase in effeciency or security.
#                                                       *******
