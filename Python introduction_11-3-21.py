# What is Python?
# it is popular programming language .it was created by Guido van Rossum and released in1991
# it is used for
# 1.Web development (Server side )
# 2.software development
# 3.mathematics scriptng
# What can Python do?
# 1.it is used a server to create web application
# 2.it is alongside to create workflows
# 3.it is connected to database system .it can also read and modify files.
# 4.it is used to handel big data and perform complex mathematics.
# 5.it is used for rapid prototyping-ready software development
# Why Python?
# 1.it is work on  different platform (i.e windows/Mac/Linux/Raspberry pi etc)
# 2.it has simple syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming language.
# 3.it is runs on an interpreter system,meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written this means that prototyping can be very quick
# 4.it can be treated in a procedural way an object oriented way or a functional way.
# Python syntax compared to other programming languages.
# 1.it is designed for readability and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
# 2.it is used new lines to complete a command,as opposed to other programming language which often use semicolons or parentheses.
# 3.it relies on indentation using whitespcae such as the scope of loop function and classes other programming languages often used curly -brackets for this purpose
# e.g
# print("hello world")
