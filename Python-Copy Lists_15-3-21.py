# Copy a list
# you can not copy a list simply by typing list2=list=1,because :list2 will only be a refernce to list1 and changes made
# in list1 will automatically also be made in list2.
# there are ways to make a copy ,one way is to use the built -in-list method copy()
# E.x
# Make a copy a list with the copy() method
# thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "blackcurrent", "mango", "papaya"]
# fruits=thislist.copy()
# print(fruits)
# another way too make a copy is to use the built-in-method.
# list()
# >make a copy of a list with the list() method.
# thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "blackcurrent", "mango", "papaya"]
# mylist=list(thislist)
# print(mylist)
