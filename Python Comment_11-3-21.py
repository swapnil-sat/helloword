# it can be used to explain python code .it can be used to make the code more readeble .
# it is used to prevent execution when testing code.
# >Creating a comment .
# it is start with a symbol '#" and python will ignore them:
# E.g
# this is comment
# print("Hello World")
# it is placed at the end of a line and Python will ignore the rest of the line:
# E.g
# print("Hello World") #this is a comment
# Comment does not have to be explained the code ,it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:
# E.g
# print("Hello world")
# print("cheers,mate!")
# ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
# >Multiline comments.
# it does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.
# to add a multiline comment to cloud insert a # for each line
# e.g
# this is a comment
# Written in
# more than just one line
# print("Hello world")
#since python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable you can add a multiline string (triple quotes)in your code ,and place your comment inside it:
# E.g
"""this is comment written in more than just one line """
# print("hello world!")
# the string is not assigned to a variable ,python will read the code but then ignore it and you have made a multiline comment.
