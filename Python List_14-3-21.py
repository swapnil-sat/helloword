# mylist=["apple","banana","cherry"]
# >>List<<<<
# it is used to store multipale items in a single variable .
# list are one of 4 built-in -data types in pyhton used to store clooecction of data ,the other 3 are Tuple,Set and Dictionary
# all with different qualities and uses.
# E.x
# Create a list
# thislist=["apple","banana","cherry"]
# print(thislist)
# >>>>>List Items<<<<<<
# List items are ordered,changebale and allow duplicate values.
# List items are indexed,the first item has index[0] the second item has index[1] etc.
# >>>Ordered<<<<<
# the items have a defined order,annd that order will not change .
# if you add new items to a list ,the new items will be placed at the end of the list.
# >>>>>>>there are some list methods thhat will change the order ,but in general the order of the items will not change
# >>Changeable<<<<<
# We can change ,add,and remomve items in a list after it has been created.
# >>>Allow Duplicates<<<
# lists are indexed ,list can have items with the same value.
# E.x
# thislist=["apple","banana","Cherry","apple","banana"]
# print(thislist)
# >>>>List Length<<<<<
# to determine how many items a list has use the len() function.
# E.x
# thislist=["apple","banana","Cherry"]
# print(len(thislist))
# >>>>>>List Items -Data types.
# E.x
# string,int and boolean data type
# list1=["Apple","Mango","Banana","Cherry"]
# list2=[1,2,3,4,5]
# list3=[True,False,False]
# print(list1)
# print(list2)
# print(list3)
# A list can contain different data types:
# E.x
# A list with strings integers and boolean values:
# list1=["abc",34,True,40,"Swapnil"]
# print(list1)
# >>>>type<<<<<
# from python's perspective ,lists are definde as objets with the data type 'list'
# <class 'list>'
# E.x
# list1=["Apple","Mango","Banana","Cherry"]
# print(type(list1))
# >>>>The list() Constructor.
# it is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list .
# E.x
# thislist=list (("Apple","Mango","Banana","Cherry"))
# print(thislist)
# >>>>Python collection (Arrays)
# there are four collection data types in the Python programming language.
# List- it is collection which is ordered and changabel .allows duplicate members.
# Tuple-it is collection which is ordered and unchageable allows duplicate members.
# Set-it is collection which is unordered and unindexed .No duplicate members.
# Dictionary-it is a collection which is unordered and changablle .No duplicate members.
